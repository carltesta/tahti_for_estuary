# tahti_for_estuary
formatted version of the [tahti](https://tahti.studio) library for use in the estuary live coding platform

To use this library in Estuary, simply type ```!reslist "https://carltesta.github.io/tahti_for_estuary/resources.json"``` into the Terminal/Chat.

Since the [Tahti Studio](https://tahti.studio/) Default Library was recently released as an [open source library](https://github.com/tahti-studio/tahti-default-library) under the Boost Software License 1.0, I decided to create a version of it to enable easy import into the [Estuary Live Coding Platform](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca). This sample library has a lot of useful drum sounds for use in Estuary live coding compositions and improvisations.
